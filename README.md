* Significantly updated the UI and Fonts. We have a new left side navigation that allows us to much better organize content. 
* Profile and subscription info has been moved to the top right to be more consistent.
* Added an "at a glance" dashboard to replace the old one. The previous dashboard is still there, just under "Analytics"

# 2016-04-05
* Added Spanish language support for the Tab. Any site using the default locale scheme (inspecting the html "lang" attribute) that has any "es" or "es-*" lang attribute will now show our default "es" labels.  Alternatively, if a customer is using custom locale mappings and have any urls set to an "es" locale, the Spanish labels will show there, as well.  If customers have set up any custom labels for an "es" or "es-*" locale, those will take precedence over the new Spanish defaults.

# 2016-03-30
* Removed archived Q&A from the "Question Groups" page. They can be unarchived from the Q&A page.

# 2015-11-06
* Released AnswerMarks. AnswerMarks are fully customizable visual targets, by default circles with question marks in them, that give users a place to click to find more information about page objects. See our [Using AnswerMarks Guide](http://www.answerdash.com/hubfs/Learning_Resources/AnswerMarks_HOWTO.pdf) for more detail.

# 2015-10-13
* Added a new browse mode to the search experience we're calling the AnswerBase. When enabled, the "See more" link in the popular questions list becomes a "See all questions..." link that activates a full-page window showing all of the questions available on the page, organized by question groups, and using the name of the question groups. To enable the AnswerBase, first check your question groups and question group names to make sure they're suitable as headers, then find the "AnswerBase" settings and click "On".
